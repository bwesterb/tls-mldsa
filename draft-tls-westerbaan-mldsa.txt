1.  Introduction

   ML-DSA [FIPS204] is one of the first two post-quantum signature
   schemes standardised by NIST.  It is a module-lattice based scheme.

   This memo specifies how ML-DSA can be negotiated for authentication
   in TLS via the "signature_algorithms" extension.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ML-DSA SignatureSchemes Types

   As defined in [RFC8446], the SignatureScheme namespace is used for
   the negotiation of signature scheme for authentication via the
   "signature_algorithms" extension.  This document adds three new
   SignatureSchemes types for the three ML-DSA parameter sets as
   follows.

   enum {
     mldsa44(0x0900),
     mldsa65(0x0901),
     mldsa87(0x0902)
   } SignatureScheme;

   These correspond to ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-64, and ML-DSA-87 defined in
   [FIPS204] respectively.  Note that these should not be confused with
   prehashed variants such as HashML-DSA-44 alsodefined in [FIPS204]: we
   use the pure version.

   The corresponding end-entity certificate when negotiated must use id-
   ML-DSA-44, id-ML-DSA-64, id-ML-DSA-87 respectively as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates].

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a new entry to the TLS SignatureSchemes
   registry, according to the procedures in Section 6 of [TLSIANA].
