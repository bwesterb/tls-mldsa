--- abstract

This memo specifies how the post-quantum signature scheme ML-DSA (FIPS 204)
is used for authentication in TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

ML-DSA is a post-quantum module-lattice based digital signature algorothm
standardised by NIST in {{!FIPS204=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.204}}.

This memo specifies how ML-DSA can be negotiated for authentication in TLS 1.3
via the "signature_algorithms" and "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions.

# Conventions and Definitions

# ML-DSA SignatureSchemes Types
As defined in {{RFC8446}}, the SignatureScheme namespace is used for
the negotiation of signature scheme for authentication via the
"signature_algorithms" and "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions.
This document adds three new SignatureSchemes
types for the three ML-DSA parameter sets as follows.

~~~
enum {
  mldsa44(0x0904),
  mldsa65(0x0905),
  mldsa87(0x0906)
} SignatureScheme;
~~~

These correspond to ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87 defined
in {{FIPS204}} respectively. Note that these are different
from the HashML-DSA pre-hashed variantsadefined in Section 5.4 of {{FIPS204}}.

The signature MUST be computed and verified as specified in
{{Section 4.4.3 of RFC8446}}.

The context parameter defined in {{FIPS204}} Algorithm 2 and 3
MUST be the empty string.

The corresponding end-entity certificate when negotiated MUST
use id-ML-DSA-44, id-ML-DSA-65, id-ML-DSA-87 respectively as
defined in {{I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates}}.

The schemes defined in this document MUST NOT be used in TLS 1.2 {{RFC5246}}.
A peer that receives ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify message in a TLS
1.2 connection with schemes defined in this document MUST abort the connection
with an illegal_parameter alert.

# Security Considerations

TODO Security


# IANA Considerations

This document requests new entries to the TLS SignatureScheme registry,
according to the procedures in {{Section 6 of TLSIANA}}.
